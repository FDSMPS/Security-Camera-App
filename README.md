# Security-Camera-App


General Information:
Our team wishes to design and build a camera-based security system that uses motion detection and face detection to determine whether an intruder is present on a userâ€™s property. With our Face Detection Security system, properties will be monitored using a motion detector and security camera. Our security system will perform face detection on the security feed, and users will be notified of intrusions through an application on their phone. Users will be able to take action following a notification of intrusion, as well as view a live feed of their property, among other features. This application which controls the camera and transmits the data


Supported version: 
* Python 3.7 
* Tensor Flow 1.14

To dos:
* Send notifications to users subscribed to the current camera


3rd Party Libraries used:
* Tensor Flow
* NumPy
